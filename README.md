Aiming to reduce political bias and raise political awareness, we have built Voter - an iOS application.

It is hard to find unbiased, reliable information in the Internet, specially when regarding politics. To reduce this issue,
we decided to provide a simple, easy-to use iOS app that provides you with data such as your current representatives and their
competitors in future election. Candidates' information are provided at local, state and federal levels, including background descriptions,
social media links and current office held. 

To acquire the data for this application, we made extensive use of the Civic Information API (https://developers.google.com/civic-information/),
which included most of the essential information we needed.
